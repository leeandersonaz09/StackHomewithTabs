![](https://i.picasion.com/pic90/e4f276798c0b8c02bdf68cb3fbaa9928.gif)


## Functionality Implementention Sprints

- [x] Tabs
- [x] Home, Tab1, Tab2, Tab3
- [x] Tests

You'll need to have [Expo](https://expo.io/learn) installed on your machine in order to follow along.

## Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/msfcampos05/DescontoFacilApp.git`
- `yarn install` / `npm install`

NPM:

```sh
npm install
```

YARN:

```sh
yarn install
```


## Running

### Use the `yarn/expo/npm start`, `yarn/npm ios`, or `yarn/npm android` tasks as detailed below.
NPM && EXPO:

```sh
npm start or expo start
```

YARN:

```sh
yarn start
```
  ## Available Scripts

  This app was initialized using Yarn and therefore you should use Yarn commands going forward.

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks.

* [Available Scripts](#available-scripts)
  * [yarn start](#npm-start)
  * [yarn ios](#npm-run-ios)
  * [yarn android](#npm-run-android)

  ### `yarn start`

  Runs your app in development mode.

  Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

  Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

  ```
  yarn start --reset-cache
  ```

  #### `yarn ios`

  Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

  #### `yarn android`

  Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
